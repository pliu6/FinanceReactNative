# FinanceReactNative

iOS's Stocks App clone written in [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) for demo purpose (available both iOS and Android). Data is pulled from [Yahoo Finance](finance.yahoo.com).

The original implementation is from https://github.com/7kfpun/FinanceReactNative.

I am working on the implementation based on Redux instead of alt (a flux implementation).
It is for practice and fun.
